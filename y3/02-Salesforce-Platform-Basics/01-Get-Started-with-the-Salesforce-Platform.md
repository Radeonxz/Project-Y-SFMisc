# Get Started with the Salesforce Platform

## Introduction to Salesforce

Salesforce comes with a lot of `standard functionality`, or out-of-the-box products and features that you can use to run your business.

## Terms

1. An `app` in Salesforce is a set of objects, fields, and other functionality that supports a business process. You can see which app you’re using and switch between apps using the App Launcher.

2. `Objects` are tables in the Salesforce database that store a particular kind of information. There are standard objects like Accounts and Contacts and `custom objects` like the Property object you see in the graphic.

3. `Records` are rows in object database tables. Records are the actual data associated with an object. Here, the 211 Charles Street property is a record.

4. `Fields` are columns in object database tables. Both standard and custom objects have fields. On our Property object, we have fields like Address and Price.

## Customize the Salesforce Platform

Developing without code is known as `declarative development`. With declarative development, you use forms and drag-and-drop tools to perform powerful customization tasks. The platform also offers `programmatic development`, which uses things like Lightning components. But if you’re not a programmer, you can still build some amazing things on the platform.

1. From the gear icon click Setup to launch the setup page. We use Setup a lot, so remember this step!
2. Click the `Object Manager` tab.
3. Click `Contact`.
4. Under Fields & Relationships, click `New`.
5. A data type indicates what kind of information your field holds. For this field, pick Checkbox and click `Next`.
6. The Field Label is what you see on the Contact page. Enter Prequalified? and click `Next`.
7. Click Next again.
8. Check the checkbox to add the new field to the Contact Page Layout and then click `Save`.
