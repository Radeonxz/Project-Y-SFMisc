# Power Up with AppExchange

## Whereâ€™d My App Go?

Apps are installed using something called a package. To find the package:

1. From Setup, search and select `Installed Packages` in the Quick Find box.
2. Click the name of the package you installed. It will be the same name from the AppExchange download page.
3. Click `View Components` to see more information about the package. The Package Details page shows you all the components, including custom fields, custom objects, and Apex classes in the package. This information helps you determine whether you have any conflicts in your own customizations.
