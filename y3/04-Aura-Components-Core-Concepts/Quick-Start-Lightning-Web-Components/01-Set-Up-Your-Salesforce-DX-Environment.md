# Set Up Your Salesforce DX Environment

## Introduction

Lightning Web Components is a new programming model for building Lightning components. It uses web standards breakthroughs, can coexist and interoperate with the Aura programming model, and delivers unparalleled performance.

The Salesforce Developer Experience (DX) is a set of tools that streamlines the entire development life cycle. It improves team development and collaboration, facilitates automated testing and continuous integration, and makes the release cycle more efficient and agile.

## Install the Command Line Interface (CLI)

Use the Salesforce CLI to control the full application life cycle of your Salesforce apps. With it you can easily create environments for development and testing, synchronize source code between your orgs and VCS, and execute tests.

See the (Salesforce CLI Setup Guide)[https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_intro.htm] for complete installation instructions.

1. Install the CLI from [https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli].
2. Confirm the CLI is properly installed and on the latest version by running the following command from the command line.

```
sfdx update
```

You should see output like `sfdx-cli: Updating CLI....`
