# Discover Use Cases for the Platform

## High Impact, Low Effort

Every time you create a custom object, you automatically get something called `Chatter feed tracking`. `Chatter feed tracking` provides a way for multiple people to comment and collaborate on a particular record. The discussions and decisions are stored on the `record` so everyone can stay up to date on important decisions.

Processes with these traits are great candidates for early projects on the Salesforce platform:

- Heavy email collaboration
- Reliance on spreadsheets
- Shared local documents
- Time-intensive, repetitive manual steps
- Impact on only a few departments (you want to minimize the number of stakeholders while youâ€™re still learning)
