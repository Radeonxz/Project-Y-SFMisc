# Understand the Salesforce Architecture

## Salesforce Structure

- Salesforce is a cloud company. Everything we offer resides in the trusted, multitenant cloud.
- The Salesforce platform is the foundation of our services. It’s powered by metadata and made up of different parts, like data services, artificial intelligence, and robust APIs for development.
- All our apps sit on top of the platform. Our prebuilt offerings like Sales Cloud and Marketing Cloud, along with apps you build using the platform, have consistent, powerful functionality.
- Everything is integrated. Our platform technologies like predictive analytics and the development framework are built into everything we offer and everything you build.

## Sharing Is Caring in the Multitenant Cloud

This idea is `multitenancy`. `Multitenancy` is a great word for making you sound smart at dinner parties, but really all it means is that you’re sharing resources. Salesforce provides a core set of services to all our customers in the multitenant cloud. No matter the size of your business, you get access to the same computing power, data storage, and core features.

## The Magic of Metadata

To put it simply, metadata is data about data. Wait. That’s not simple at all. When we say data about data, we’re really talking about the structure of your Salesforce org.

## All About That API

Fundamentally, `APIs` allow different pieces of software to connect to each other and exchange information.

When you add a custom object or field, the platform automatically creates an API name that serves as an access point between your org and the database. Salesforce uses that API name to retrieve the metadata and data you’re looking for.
