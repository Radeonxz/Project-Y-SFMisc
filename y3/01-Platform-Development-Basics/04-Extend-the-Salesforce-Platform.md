# Extend the Salesforce Platform

## Lightning Platform APIs

APIs Salesforce provides:

| `API`               | `What you can do with it`                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SOAP API            | Integrate your org’s data with other applications using standard SOAP protocols.                                                               |
| REST API            | Access objects in your org using standard REST protocols.                                                                                      |
| Metadata API        | Manage customizations in your org and build tools that manage your metadata model.                                                             |
| Tooling API         | Build custom development tools for platform applications.                                                                                      |
| Marketing Cloud API | Expose Marketing Cloud capabilities with the REST API and get comprehensive access to most email functionality with the SOAP API.              |
| Bulk API            | Load, delete, and perform asynchronous queries on large data sets.                                                                             |
| Streaming API       | Send and receive notifications securely and efficiently. Notifications can reflect data changes in your org, or custom events.                 |
| Connect REST API    | Build UI for Commerce, CMS-Managed Content, Experience Cloud Sites, Files, Notifications, Topics, and more.                                    |
| Mobile SDK          | While it’s technically a software development kit, it’s worth including here. Integrate Native or Hybrid mobile apps directly with Salesforce. |
